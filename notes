- try to enforce (investiage) how notion of Slots are behaving for Indexer service (https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/supervisor/)
- on real deployment
    - remove mm
    - instantiate indexer using druid image (tuning by env - mounting files as volumes)


- 4 mm vs indexer (same work to be done, complexity of data)
    - expected result: performance will be probably indentical

- but choking with too much slots to be processed - will probably queue task on mm/
    - what happens when Indexer is overwhelmed
